Generate a lighting theme based on this topic "{{TOPIC}}". On the first line write a 1 or 2 word name for the theme for quick identification. Then, write a line for each light formatted in csv with these fields:
lifxId - string - The id from lifx for the target light.
hue - int - Between 0 and 360, representing the color hue in degree which changes the color.
saturation - int - Between 0 and 100, representing the color intensity from 0% to 100%.
brightness - int - Between 0 and 100, representing the light brightness from 0% to 100%.
kelvin - int - Between 2500 and 9000, representing the color temperature.
duration - int - Fade the color to the new value over time (in milliseconds).

for example
```
Morning Bloom Blues
d073d52cb301, 55, 90, 90, 5500, 500
d073d52df872, 45, 50, 70, 4500, 500
...continue for each light
```

Using 0 for the hue and saturation will result in the light showing as the temperature value. Avoid using neutral tones as this can cause some unanticipated effects.
